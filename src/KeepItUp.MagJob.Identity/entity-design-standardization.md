# Entity Design Standardization Report

## Overview

This document describes the standardization of entity design patterns implemented across the KeepItUp.MagJob.Identity project. The changes ensure a consistent approach to creating, modifying, and working with domain entities throughout the application.

## Standardized Patterns

### 1. Base Entity Pattern

Enhanced the `BaseEntity` class to provide a consistent foundation for all entities:

- Added XML documentation for better code understanding
- Added `RegisterDomainEventAndUpdate` method to standardize domain event registration with timestamp updates
- Ensured consistent constructor access level

### 2. Entity Creation Pattern

Standardized the entity creation pattern across all entities:

- Consistent use of static `Create` factory methods for entity instantiation
- Proper input validation using `Guard.Against` in factory methods
- Domain event registration in all entity creation methods
- Private constructors for EF Core and factory method usage

### 3. Domain Event Pattern

Implemented a consistent domain event pattern:

- Created domain events for all significant state changes
- Standardized domain event names (e.g., `EntityCreatedEvent`, `EntityUpdatedEvent`)
- Consistent property naming and access patterns in domain events
- Used `RegisterDomainEventAndUpdate` to combine event registration and timestamp updates

### 4. Property Access Modifiers

Standardized property access modifiers across all entities:

- Public getters with private setters for all entity properties
- Private backing fields for collections with public read-only access
- Protected access for methods intended for inheritance

## Specific Changes

### User Entity

- Updated `Create` method to validate all inputs consistently
- Added domain event registration on user creation
- Standardized update methods to register domain events and update timestamps
- Replaced direct base class `Update()` calls with `RegisterDomainEventAndUpdate`

### Member Entity

- Added domain event registration in `Create` method
- Created new domain events for member-related operations
- Standardized role assignment and revocation methods to register appropriate events
- Improved XML documentation for better code understanding

### Role Entity

- Standardized entity creation pattern with factory method and validation
- Added domain event registration in all state change operations
- Created domain events for role-related operations (creation, updates, permission changes)
- Standardized method implementations for permission management

## Domain Event Infrastructure

Created new domain event classes to support the standardized pattern:

- `MemberCreatedEvent`
- `RoleAssignedToMemberEvent`
- `RoleRevokedFromMemberEvent`
- `RoleUpdatedEvent`
- `RolePermissionsUpdatedEvent`

## Benefits

This standardization provides several benefits:

1. **Consistency**: Unified approach to entity design reduces cognitive load for developers
2. **Maintainability**: Standardized patterns make code easier to understand and extend
3. **Reliability**: Consistent validation prevents invalid entity states
4. **Event Traceability**: Proper domain event usage enables better system monitoring and event-driven features
5. **Documentation**: Improved and consistent XML documentation helps new developers understand the code

## Next Steps

To fully standardize the codebase, similar patterns should be applied to:

1. Remaining domain entities not covered in this update
2. Repository implementations to ensure consistent data access patterns
3. Use Case implementations to ensure consistent application of domain logic
