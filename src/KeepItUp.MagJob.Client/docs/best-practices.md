## Angular Best Practices

### Project Structure

- Follow the Angular style guide for organizing modules, components, and services
- Group related features into feature modules
- Use lazy loading for feature modules to improve initial load time
- Keep shared components, directives, and pipes in a shared module

### Component Organization

- Follow the single responsibility principle for components
- Use smart (container) and presentational (dumb) component pattern
  - Smart components manage state and business logic
  - Presentational components focus on UI rendering with inputs/outputs
- Keep components small and focused on specific functionality
- Extract reusable logic into services

### Naming Conventions

- Use consistent naming patterns:
  - Components: `feature-name.component.ts`
  - Services: `feature-name.service.ts`
  - Interfaces: `feature-name.interface.ts`
  - Enums: `feature-name.enum.ts`
- Use kebab-case for file names and selector names
- Use PascalCase for class names
- Use camelCase for properties and methods

### Templates

- Keep templates clean and readable
- Extract complex logic from templates into component methods
- Use the `async` pipe for handling observables in templates
- Avoid complex expressions in templates
- Use `trackBy` with `*ngFor` for better performance

## TypeScript Standards

### General Guidelines

- Enable strict type checking in `tsconfig.json`
- Always define proper types for variables, parameters, and return values
- Avoid using `any` type; use proper interfaces or type aliases instead
- Use readonly properties when values should not be modified
- Use access modifiers (private, protected, public) appropriately

### Code Organization

- Follow a consistent order for class members:
  1. Properties
  2. Constructor
  3. Lifecycle hooks
  4. Public methods
  5. Private methods
- Keep methods short and focused on a single task
- Use meaningful variable and function names that describe their purpose

### Immutability

- Treat inputs as immutable
- Create new objects/arrays instead of mutating existing ones
- Use the spread operator for creating copies with modifications
- Consider using immutable data structures for complex state

## Component Design

### Inputs and Outputs

- Clearly define component APIs with @Input() and @Output() decorators
- Document expected input types and output events
- Use OnChanges lifecycle hook to react to input changes
- Avoid two-way binding when possible

### Change Detection

- Use OnPush change detection strategy for better performance
- Minimize state changes that trigger change detection
- Use pure pipes instead of methods in templates
- Avoid direct DOM manipulation

### Component Communication

- Use @Input/@Output for parent-child communication
- Use services with observables for unrelated component communication
- Consider using NgRx or similar state management for complex applications
- Avoid excessive event emitters that create complex event chains

## State Management

### Local State

- Keep component state minimal and focused
- Use services for sharing state between related components
- Consider using BehaviorSubject for simple shared state

### Global State

- Use NgRx or similar state management libraries for complex applications
- Follow the single source of truth principle
- Implement proper actions, reducers, selectors, and effects
- Document state shape with interfaces

### Data Fetching

- Use services for API communication
- Implement proper error handling for HTTP requests
- Use the async pipe to handle subscription lifecycle
- Consider implementing caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## Performance Optimization

### General Guidelines

- Use lazy loading for feature modules
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- Optimize change detection with OnPush strategy
- Use pure pipes instead of methods in templates

### Bundle Size

- Use tree-shakable libraries
- Implement code splitting
- Analyze bundle size regularly with tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer
- Remove unused dependencies

### Rendering Performance

- Avoid expensive computations in templates
- Use trackBy with ngFor
- Debounce user inputs that trigger expensive operations
- Implement pagination for large data sets

## Testing

### Unit Testing

- Write tests for all components and services
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

### Integration Testing

- Test component interactions
- Use TestBed for Angular-specific testing
- Mock HTTP requests with HttpClientTestingModule

### E2E Testing

- Cover critical user flows with E2E tests
- Keep E2E tests focused and independent
- Use page objects to abstract UI interaction details

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Errors

- Implement global error handling with ErrorHandler
- Log errors appropriately
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages

### API Errors

- Handle HTTP errors consistently
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Provide meaningful error feedback to users
- Consider implementing offline support for critical features

## Security

### Authentication and Authorization

- Implement proper token management
- Use HttpInterceptors for adding auth headers
- Never store sensitive information in localStorage
- Implement proper session timeout handling

### Data Protection

- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Use Angular's built-in protections against XSS
- Implement CSRF protection
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Sensitive Information

- Never log sensitive user information
- Mask sensitive data in the UI
- Use HTTPS for all API communication
- Follow data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

By following these best practices, we ensure that our codebase remains maintainable, performant, and secure. These guidelines should be reviewed and updated periodically as new best practices emerge in the Angular ecosystem.
